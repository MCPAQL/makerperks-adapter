## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Credential delivery is danger-tiered

When a flow requires a stored credential to apply, the package SHALL include it only by **kind and
danger tier**: a credential SHALL be decrypted from the vault and included in the package's
assembled inputs (its use audited as a real use) ONLY when it is a **`scoped_token`** AND the flow
is at **danger ≤ 2** AND the apply `action_url`'s host shares the **registrable domain of the
program's own `url`** (or is on the operator-configured form-host allowlist) AND the program's source
feed is **not `untrusted`**. A `password` or `identity_document` SHALL **never** be auto-exposed,
regardless of danger level — it stays pending for out-of-band supply (a reusable password / an
irreplaceable identity document is not auto-filled). For a flow at **danger ≥ 3** (payment / real
identity) **no** credential SHALL be exposed. When the apply URL's host does not match the program's
registrable domain (an injected redirect) or the source feed is `untrusted`, the credential SHALL
stay pending (fail safe, labeled — never a hard error), so the maker may supply it out-of-band
against a URL they trust. When no vault key is available, a credential SHALL stay pending regardless
of tier (fail safe). A flow that needs no stored credential SHALL apply with inputs and URL alone.

#### Scenario: A low-danger scoped_token on the provider's own domain is included for the agent

- **WHEN** a danger ≤ 2 flow requests a `scoped_token`, a vault key is available, and the apply URL's
  host shares the registrable domain of the program's `url`
- **THEN** the credential is decrypted and appears in the package's assembled inputs, and its use is
  audited

#### Scenario: An injected off-domain apply URL withholds the credential

- **WHEN** a danger ≤ 2 flow requests a `scoped_token` but the apply `action_url`'s host does not
  share the program's registrable domain and is not on the operator form-host allowlist
- **THEN** the credential is not decrypted; it remains pending for out-of-band supply with a reason
  noting the URL was off the provider's domain

#### Scenario: An untrusted feed never auto-exposes a credential

- **WHEN** a danger ≤ 2 flow whose program was ingested from an `untrusted` feed requests a
  `scoped_token`
- **THEN** the credential is not decrypted or included; it remains pending regardless of the URL

#### Scenario: A password or identity_document is never auto-exposed

- **WHEN** a danger ≤ 2 flow requests a `password` or `identity_document` vault credential
- **THEN** the credential is not decrypted or included; it remains pending for out-of-band supply

#### Scenario: A high-danger credential is never exposed

- **WHEN** a danger ≥ 3 flow requests a vault credential of any kind
- **THEN** the credential is not decrypted or included; it remains pending for out-of-band supply

#### Scenario: No vault key fails safe

- **WHEN** no vault key is configured and a flow requests a credential
- **THEN** the credential stays pending regardless of danger level
